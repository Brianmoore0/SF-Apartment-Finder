A little More About Pacific Heights: 
When Hollywood wants to film a chase scene, Pacific Heights is where it comes for cinematic thrills. Some of the oldest, grandest, and largest homes in the city can be found in highly affluent Pacific Heights, which features an ample stock of Victorians, Edwardians, Mission Revivals, and homes in the style of French chateaus. Some of the former baronial mansions now serve as elite private schools, including San Francisco University High School, Drew School, Town School For Boys, and Convent of the Sacred Heart (in the former Flood Mansion). 

Pacific Heights has gorgeous parks, playgrounds, and, bounded by the Presidio, easy access to open space and miles of hiking, running, and biking trails. The main shopping district can be found on Fillmore Street, which runs north and south through Pacific Heights and is home to some of the city's chicest boutiques and choicest restaurants.

Much larger than most apartments and can comfortably fit a dining table and still leave a lot of room for guests to mingle around. Almost a focal point for entertainment. New granite counter tops and natural wood cabinets makes the kitchen stands out.

The flat is located in a great part of the Mission. Only a few blocks to 16th Street BART, Food Co., Rainbow Grocery, Best Buy and Office Max. There are also a lot of places to eat just within in 3 blocks such as sushi, BBQ, Mexican, ect.. The freeway on ramp to Oakland or San Jose is conveniently just two blocks away! The Mission gets really good weather and you never get fog here compared to the other SF neighborhoods. Great location, nice weather and spacious flat. What more can you ask for?

The Location: In the heart of Cow Hollow/ Marina. Cross streets are Pierce & Filbert! In a residential, quiet, safe area where you’re walking distance from: Union Street, Chestnut Street, Fort Mason, Crissy Field, Palace of Fine Arts, lots of workout studios, gyms, bars, restaurants. Also a block away from tech shuttle stops! We LOVE the location.

The Apartment/Your Room: This is a 3 bedroom/ 1 bath apartment in a 2-unit building. Our upstairs neighbor is a sweet elderly lady :) You would have a spacious bedroom that fits a queen bed, dresser, nightstand & has a closet. The room can come unfurnished or furnished with a queen bedframe & mini couch. The apartment has all new kitchen appliances, dishwasher, 2 (!!) ovens, pantry space &  lots of cupboards, stacked washer & dryer in - unit, a kitchen dining area, a backyard patio, hallway closet & a sunny street-facing living room

Details: The monthly rate is $1700/mo, Security deposit is $2900, the lease is a year long & would start on May 24, and all utilities come out to about $100 per person per month given this is only a 2-unit building. Move in date is flexible, rent would be paid for the first of the month. Please be prepared to fill out an application for the landlord (includes credit report, proof of income, etc!) 

The Roommates: Two gals in their mid-twenties looking for another gal to join our space who is employed, doesn’t work remote, social, respectful of common spaces/cleans up after herself,  and doesn’t bring the party home! We keep our home quiet during the week, and while we both enjoy doing our own things on the weekend, we’re down for chill nights in together.
We’ve been in this apartment for a year now and love it!

A bit about each of us:
Alex - 23, works in tech, typical 9 - 5 schedule with the occasional WFH Friday, out and about on the weekends in the city and exploring the beautiful state of California, loves soul cycle and corepower yoga, painting, reading, taking long walks along Crissy Field, going to farmers markets, and happy hours with friends. 

Britt - 25, works in consulting, currently travels M-Th/F about two weeks out of the month and works from home the rest of the time, but that travel schedule is always subject to change, enjoys going out with friends on the weekend, hiking, cooking/baking, reading, lots of tv and movie binges, and traveling.

A little more about the Richmond District:
The Richmond has abundant outdoor opportunities for those who enjoy bundling up on foggy days. Both Ocean Beach and Golden Gate Park are within easy reach, and a good portion of the area has wide streets and relatively flat terrain for biking and walking. Several Muni bus lines serve the area, including the 38 Geary and the 1 California. Both the 38 and the 1 offer express buses to the Financial District during commute hours.

Hikers head to the Lands End Trail, which meanders along the cliffs above the sea, past the Sutro Baths and the Legion of Honor. Numerous walking and jogging paths crisscross adjacent Golden Gate Park. At the private Lincoln Park Golf Club, golfers enjoy lovely ocean views from every hole.

Cultural opportunities abound in this neighborhood as well. The Legion of Honor in Lincoln Park features art from around the world. The popular art-house Balboa Theatre regularly shows second- and third-run Euro and independent flicks. Golden Gate Park’s renowned museums are just a short drive or bus ride away.

A little more about Russian Hill:
Dazzling views, the hairpin turns down brick-paved Lombard Street, and the Hyde-Powell cable cars make iconic Russian Hill a favorite with tourists. Locals savor the steep garden walks, the tiny pocket parks, and Swensen's Ice Cream on the corner of Union and Hyde streets. Despite the steep streets, Russian Hill is a highly walkable urban enclave, with many residents able to commute to work on foot.  

Restaurants and boutiques along the tree-lined Hyde Street between Jackson and Union streets exude European charm. Polk and Green streets boast international cuisine — Abrazo, Eight AM, The Italian Homemade, Berber, Leopold's and Cafe de Casa to name a few.

A little more about Lower Pacific Heights:
Between California Street and Geary Boulevard and Presidio Avenue and Gough Streets lies Lower Pacific Heights, a new name for an old neighborhood. This community boasts a central location, proximity to Muni bus lines (the 1 California, the 2 Clement, the 3 Jackson, the 22 Fillmore, and the 38 Geary), and great shopping along the main axis, Fillmore Street. 

Ethnically and economically diverse, the neighborhood offers a buffet of city living. Residents can choose from the nightlife along Fillmore Street, including blues venue Boom Boom Room; Japantown and its extraordinary urban mall offering restaurants and specialty retail stores; recently renovated Lafayette Park; and the sunny, spacious, and welcoming Yoga Works on Divisadero Street, where another business district offers a range of restaurants and bars.

**Garage Parking Info: Parking is $325/mo per vehicle. 

**SF City Street Parking: The city of San Francisco, unfortunately, does not recognize our address as an approved locale for residential parking permits. This is due, primarily, to the number of vehicles addressed to our community and the fact that we offer parking in the community. In addition, the city is not currently offering street permits to many of the newer multi-family housing developments within proximity to the new Chase Center and Oracle Park.

Utilities: It is the responsibility of the resident to handle all utilities. Electricity is paid through PG&E.Water, sewage, trash services and internet are billed together through Minol.

Greetings Potential Future Roommate,
Today, my fine friend, is your lucky day. As it so happens, we’re looking for third roommate at our palatial 3 bedroom, 2 bath condo which we affectionately refer to as “The Mission Oasis"". *If interested, please apply at the link below*.

Fast Facts:

WHERE: We’re at 15th Street near Dolores.
WHEN: The unfurnished bedroom is available now through April -- later move-in possible and negotiable. We can be flexible for the right person). Bed & Desk are available for this room if needed.
HOW MUCH: Rent is $1975 per month. Utilities (electric, internets) are roughly $40-60/mo/person.

About the Apartment & Building:
The Oasis is a spacious (~1550 sq ft) condo nestled in a small cul-de-sac on 15th Street near Dolores. The apartment’s namesake comes from the uniquely peaceful and green gated garden. It's located just couple blocks from both BART, MUNI, Whole Foods, and Dolores Park.

The shared living room is quite large, roughly 16’ x 26’, not including the open kitchen and communal patio space that open up onto it. There is ample storage throughout.

The building has a gym, sauna and an in-resident manager who is around to receive packages for you. Laundry room is a couple doors away from our unit with 2 high-efficiency washers and 2 dryers, and a table to fold clothes. Several reserved parking spaces for guests and a protected garage parking spot for additional $175/mo. The posted photos are from the original listing - we'll have a different layout and furniture.

About the Room:
Your new room is approx. 11' x 16' with a large, two door mirrored closet. 

About R:
Mid 30s. Loves to design things. Frequently fucking around in the kitchen. Passionate about live music, film and his pup, Jack. Physically and socially active. Enjoys being outdoors, snowboarding, trying new whiskeys, building Lego, and playing guitar. He's in the master bedroom with 1 of the 2 bathrooms.

About Z:
30 years old. Software engineer originally from New York. You'll share a bathroom with him. More info coming soon.

About J:
Jack is a dog, but not at all like the other dogs you've met before. Incredibly intelligent, calm/well-mannered, and loving. Former Therapy animal, certified ESA. Has multiple obedience and trick awards under his belt (collar).

About You:
You're pretty cool. *Above average* clean/organized with common shared spaces. You're friendly, open minded, respectful, communicative, and pay rent on time. You pull your weight, not the hermit type, and you have your own social life/hobbies/weird shit you do. You are 420 friendly, and no live-in significant others.

We are looking for someone to join the lease, which is month-to-month (one month rent deposit). Our new roommate should be in good financial standing as our landlord will require a credit check for any new tenants.

This beautiful apartment seem like a good fit for you? Fill out the form below and help us quickly learn more about you. We'll respond very quickly. Thanks!

It will come available as of April 15th.
Just a Short walk to Bart, Muni & Caltrain lines.
½ a block to Whole Foods, and 2 blocks to Target.

We usually go with a 12-month agreement, but especially catering to Doctors and other Medical Professionals we will consider even a 3, 4, or 6 month shorter-term stay.

Right on Folsom near 4th Street.
Easy walking to everywhere downtown.

* High-Speed Internet WiFi is set and Included.
*All cookware, dishware, and even starter condiments are there upon arrival.
*Microwave, Coffee Maker, Hot Water Pot, Iron, Ironing board and more are here.
*Stainless Steel with a Granite Top Kitchen awaits with an in-unit washer & dryer!
*Beautiful wood flooring and a Carpeted Queen Size Bedroom with a Walk-In Closet.
*Larger than normal, nicely tiled full bathroom with shower over tub.
*Light and bright with walls of windows to let in lots of natural light and fresh air.
*The building and the unit are only approximately 12 years old.
*You will find it Suitcase Ready with style and comfort, as an inclusive rate of $ 3700
* Amazing Tropical Center Outdoor Courtyard steps from your unit.

For consideration, If interested and qualified, please reply with one very detailed email.  Due to current health care considerations viewings will not take place until April 15th.  This is a great condo in the perfect SOMA location and for those reasons, in the past, it has been easy for me to lease it out sight unseen when necessary. The photos attached have not been touched up at all, so what you see is what you get.

There are lots of scams here on Craigslist as we all know and this is not one of those.  After one email and one phone / video chat with me, you will see that easily and clearly.  This unit when it comes available always moves quickly.  UNIQUE: Because of how this unit sits in the back corner of the building overlooking a narrow side street, it is an extremely quiet unit the likes of what is hard to find anywhere in San Francisco.

You would have your own private entrance from the street, full private bathroom and the room is quite spacious, about the size of a studio apartment. There's a shared kitchen on the main floor, in unit laundry, and I occupy the mezzanine level. 

I'm a professional working in advertising, who travels often for work. So when I'm home, I like to be mellow and relax. I also have 2 small dogs (see pic) who are sweet and friendly and probably the best part about coming home. Also looking for another quiet, clean professional or student, who loves dogs and doesn't bring the party home. 

Location is ideal for someone who commutes as it's across from Caltrain & close to major freeways. Also nearby Pinterest, Uber, Lyft, Stripe, tons of start-ups, bus lines and easy to get downtown. There's also a Safeway, Walgreens, Starbucks, Petes, Oracle Ball Park, South Park, post office & lots of restaurants within a 2 block radius.

We can meet virtually and I can walk you around/show you all the details you'd like to see.

The apartment is a spacious, airy 'classic San Francisco' flat that has just been renovated in style! Brand new bathroom with penny tile, classic wood bead-board walls, antique restored clawfoot tub, and heater/fan; bright, elegant living room painted in rich mossy green; large, updated kitchen and breakfast nook; 2 bedrooms with super comfy queen beds, painted calming soft grey/green/blues with intricate wallpaper and wooden trim; good storage space; a new washer/dryer and a beautiful, plant-filled side-yard. This historic duplex has a ton of charm, soaring 11' ceilings, chandeliers & unique victorian details throughout with modern amenities done in character with the house. My partner and I have lived upstairs almost 5 years and really care about continuing to make things nicer, with an artistic eye and insistence on quality. When it comes to selecting finishes, fixing something as it ages or general improvements, we treat the rental flat the same as our home and look for what's right, beautiful and well designed, not what's cheap. The pictures really don't do it justice (and we're finishing last tweaks this week). We love animals and non-destructive kitties and dogs are welcome. We share the side yard (in which we have a beautiful container garden) and laundry facilities.

Come join us in our mansion in Nopa! We currently have our master bedroom open that is by far the largest room, the walk-in closet is the largest in the city and comes with a private bathroom with a dedicated shower and bathtub. You have to see it for yourself! We think this is a great space for couples who want more than a simple studio or if you want a massive room with walk-in closet and double sink bathroom to yourself!

You have roommates when you want them, but a gigantic living room with 4 sun windows, a dining room with an extra comfy couch and nice views, as well as a den upstairs give everyone plenty of room to themselves when they need to. The kitchen has a 6-burner viking range, plenty of storage for all kitchen gadgets/pantry items, a dishwasher, as well as washer and dryer. You really have to see it in person to get a feel for it.

We are in the heart of Nopa, 2 blocks away from Divis. If you know it, it's super clean, quiet and neighborhoody, while in Divis has all the action you would want. We are right by the 5/5R/31 that brings you downtown in 15 minutes. We have a GoBike station on the same block and with the Wiggle, you can bike/scooter into the mission in 10 minutes. We have a Lucky's grocery store 5 minutes away, and Trader Joe's/Target/Bi-Rite 10 minute walk away. Golden Gate Park is 10 minutes away as well, or reading a book on Alamo Square while overlooking the city is just 5 minutes.

As for the people itself, we are looking to create a community of people that want to live together. The apartment is so big that you can always have space to yourself (which everyone needs to!), but we don't want to live in an apartment where everyone hides in their rooms. The apartment is too gorgeous for that. Currently we have

J - He's originally from New Hampshire, MIT grad, knows everything about distributed systems and now a software engineer at Facebook.
J - French-American, grew up in Paris loves everything cheese, bread and wine. A video editor learning about production on the side who’s big into sustainability, zero waste, farmers markets and the outdoors. 
K - Another New Englander who got tired of shoveling her driveway. Works in restaurant operations and studies design on the side.
M - Proud Canadian from Toronto. Really into wine, cycling and photography these days, but always found in the outdoors and appropriately works at Hipcamp.com
N - Originally grew up in Berlin, Germany, watches football, but plays soccer. Dances sometimes https://nambrot.com/aroundtheworld

You - Interested in making this a clean, fun, yet relaxed home. The usual fine print of having a stable income, be a clean and courteous roommate apply. We have cleaners come by every 2 weeks and keep the place above-average clean in the first place. No pets unfortunately. The lease will be month-to-month, but we are looking for people that don't want their apartment to be just an collection of roommate after roommate like so many apartments in SF. Move-in is ASAP!

Website Here:  https://www.luxviewsf.com/

Our home is the two-story penthouse unit in a 4-unit building located in North Beach/Telegraph Hill. It is perfectly centered between The Financial District (“FiDi”), Pier 39, Fisherman's Wharf and North Beach (the Italian District).  Ideally situated and appointed for a relocating professional and her/his family, a “work team” in need of extended housing away from their home-base, or a displaced family unable to live in their normal residence due to construction or the like. 

It's walking distance (or a very short Uber ride) to the Financial District, Chinatown, and Union Square. Coit Tower is a few block away. Giants games, Boutique shopping, and world-class museums are just a short Uber ride away. And, if you just want to spend a day at home, relaxing, you'll find the top floor to be peaceful and calm high above the hustle and bustle of SF.

We provide all furniture and furnishings (bed linens, towels, etc.).  The kitchen is fully stocked with all glassware, barware, flatware and gourmet cooking essentials - you will feel right at home cooking in our home.  We supply all consumables such as sponges, paper towels, toilet paper, dish soap/tablets, laundry detergent and the like.

You can literally bring your suitcase and a toothbrush, and you’ll have everything you need for your stay.  

A complete list of additional amenities and perks listed on this page.  And if you feel like something is missing, just let us know and we will make it happen - we go above and beyond to have the most comfortable and well-appointed extended stay furnished rental in San Francisco.

Note that the penthouse has its own private entrance, as do the other three (one bedroom) apartments. The other 3 units are occupied by three long term tenants - all middle-aged professionals and all-around great people.

Ideal for a family relocating and in need of temporary housing, or a team or professionals in town for a few months.  Our home is replete with the amenities and personal touches that will make you feel at home while away from your’s.

LOCATION

Just steps to CalTrain, UCSF Mission Bay, Spark Social, parks, bike trails, AT & T Park, Safeway and much more.

Established in 1998, the Mission Bay neighborhood has been growing by leaps and bounds. What was once an industrial wasteland has continued to evolve and is on the brink of becoming one of the most hip (and unexpectedly upscale) neighborhoods in San Francisco.

The biotech industry has made its home in Mission Bay. The University of California, San Francisco put down roots here when it opened its new research campus in 2003, and in 2015 it opened San Francisco’s first new hospital in 30 years, the UCSF Medical Center at Mission Bay.

Kaiser Permanente also joined the elite medical facilities in Mission Bay when they opened up a state-of-the-art one-stop medical facility in March 2016 offering everything from adult and pediatric care to women’s health services and a pharmacy.

Homes in Mission Bay are primarily new luxury loft and condominium developments that satisfy the majority of the residents most-drawn to this neighborhood: young professionals, often tech- or biotech-minded enthusiasts, as well as students from around the globe.

Transportation reaches Mission Bay via the Muni light rail and other public transportation lines offering a quick transport to downtown. Living here also puts you close to both Caltrain and the I-80 and I-280 freeways forging a direct shot to Silicon Valley, one of many attractions for residents.

While it is not yet on the map as a foodie culture hub, more restaurants, cafes, and boutique storefronts are moving in to accommodate the professionals that work in the neighborhood and the growing number of well-to-do residents.

With its growing energy and steadfast potential, Mission Bay is paving the way to become a San Francisco destination neighborhood.

Location: 
The South of Market (SoMa) neighborhood is an industrial and urban area filled with converted warehouses, art galleries, bookstores, trendy bars, chic furniture showrooms, and some of San Francisco’s most celebrated restaurant and nightclub destinations. Also within its borders you will find some of the city’s only big box chain stores who have taken advantage of the topography.

Historically an area created on the “wrong side” of the Market Street cable car track, full of factories and Gold Rush immigrant workers, it evolved into one of the most well-known areas in the 1990s: dot-com boom central. Since the sizzle cooled, many businesses associated with the boom have closed, but new tech companies have not been deterred from moving in. SoMa is a rejuvenated district where in 2012, a young giant in the technology industry — Twitter — put down roots at the corner of Market and 10th Street, inspiring new businesses to move in to cater to the young professionals and a long list of other tech companies following suit.

SoMa is also a magnet for visitors from around the world for its famed stretch along Eleventh and Folsom known as the heart of the gay leather and S&M scene, and home to the annual fetish street fest called Folsom Street Fair.

What SoMa lacks in terms of personal outdoor green space, quiet living quarters, and parking, it makes up for in gripping energy, trendy nightlife, and its thriving tech industry.

Note, this flat is NOT the same as another separate and completely different flat in the building that is available as roommate share. There are few units in the building. If you are looking for roommate share, contact me and I will put you in touch with the other flat. All units in building renovated with similar materials.


FLAT DETAILS:

Full three separate bedrooms.  Note, rooms are different sizes.  Tenants to determine breakdown of rent between rooms.

Large separate living room.

Very large separate kitchen with plenty of space for dining and large tables, with designer large, modern, dark and clean style format porcelain tiles.  Kitchen includes stainless steel appliances, dishwasher, garbage disposal, etc.

Very dark and solid hardwood (mahogany) floors throughout entire flat, including all bedrooms, closets, hallway, living room, etc., except bathrooms and kitchen which are tiled with designer large, modern, dark and clean style format porcelain tiles.

Incredibly maintained flat.

There is an in building covered garage parking for a car and possibly a couple of motorcycles, but the car space is currently being rented out.  You can be first on the waiting list if you want.  There is also a large public and pay garage parking complex starting around ½ block away from the flat/building with some hundreds of parking spaces.  In addition, starting about ½ block away from the flat/building in various and multiple directions, there is regular street parking that is non-metered designed for residents so you don’t have to worry about having to constantly feed meters (last I heard the parking permit fee for these non-metered spaces, which allows you to park for greater than 2 hours, overnight, etc., is $110 per year, or $55 for half-year, so they’re meant for residents and applying I understand is pretty easy).  Lastly, the area is filled with businesses, so street parking spaces change hands and open up quite frequently.


LOCATION DETAILS:

Near numerous tech and other companies, such as Twitter, Uber, Square, Zynga, Dolby Laboratories, Adobe Systems, etc.

The flat/building is located in the heart and midst of one of the most bustling, vibrant, and densely concentrated collection of the hippest and chic restaurants, bistros, bars, night clubs, art galleries, wine merchants, boutiques, lounges, night spots, theaters, both specialty and large groceries, and host of other commercial businesses, in all of San Francisco.

Starting approximately 1 ½ blocks away, dozens of bars, night clubs, music venues, and lounges of every type, from traditional to eclectic, line the streets, such as Wish, Butter, Tank18, Bergerac, Calle-11sf Nightclub, Halcyon SF, Slims, Willows, Forgery Bar, Holy Cow, Audio Nightclub, SRO/Oddjob, DNA Lounge, Driftwood, Azucar Lounge, Verso, Zeitgeist, etc. A highly commercial area too -- within walking distance, are hundreds of conveniences such as Trader Joe's, Target, Foods Co., Rainbow Grocery, Costco, The Market, Best Buys, Bed Bath & Beyond, OfficeMax, etc. Technically, one doesn't need a car living in this area. This corridor continues to be one of the hippest and fastest, continuously developing commercial areas in San Francisco, offering a high level, in-demand lifestyle in one of the busiest, hip and urban environments in San Francisco. City living at its best.

Nearby and surrounding areas include Union Square and Financial District to the Northeast, Civic Center/Hayes Valley/Opera District to the North, Embarcadero to the East, Oracle Ball Park to the South, and the Mission District to the West.

We're looking for non-smokers who are clean, considerate, don't bring the party home, and are looking for long-term housing (4 months+). And while we love animals, our apartment doesn't allow pets.

About the house:
We live in a spacious 4 bedroom, 1.5 bathrooms Victorian in Lower Pac Heights. We have a living room, separate kitchen, dishwasher, in-unit washer and dryer, and a shared backyard with a patio, hammock, and a lemon tree. It's a great place to retreat to after a long day.

About the location:
Lower Pac Heights is a great, safe neighborhood that's really close to Fillmore, Polk St, and Japantown–which means you have easy access to restaurants, shops, and lots of great parks.

It looks like I will be moving soon, and so I wanted to start sharing photos of my place that I love so much. I am on a month-to-month lease so am flexible on timing, but I do want to find someone who loves how it has been furnished, decorated, and equipped, because so much time, care, and expense went into it - someone who would want to purchase the furnishings and accoutrement in the apartment as their ideal way to move in as well. 

Please let me know if that might be you, and we can start with a video tour given everything going on in the world. I look forward to meeting you! 

The apartment is incredibly spacious, and my current rent is around $3,000. This could be considered a one-bedroom or a two-bedroom depending on how you choose to lay things out. I currently have the smaller room set up as an office, however the occupant before me established the room as her bedroom.

In terms of how I have it set up currently, there is a very large bedroom with a king-sized bed, a large dining / living room combination (dining table extends to comfortably seat ten), an office (which the previous occupant used as the bedroom; could also be made into a glamorous dressing room or nursery), large kitchen and bathroom. Parking does somewhat frequently become available in the building. The view is so beautiful, unobstructed onto the park and of the Presidio trees as well as the Golden Gate Bridge. I love sitting in the bay window with a warm tea and getting some afternoon sun. The neighbors are all wonderful as most people stay in this building for years and are all introduced to each other via email upon move-in. Little touches like neighbors taking the time to drop packages from the foyer right in front of your door are so kind.

Hope to speak with you soon.",2020-04-06 19:17,[],"['2BR / 1Ba', '900ft2', 'available apr 12', 'furnished', 'apartment', 'no laundry on site', 'attached garage']",,,,apartment,no laundry on site,attached garage,2,1,900ft2,apr 12,,True,,37.8012,-122.4312

She creaks a bit and sometimes her front door gets sticky. Her ability to store lots of big stuff is nonexistent. She only allows a maximum of 4 people at a time on her wonderful rooftop deck with a panoramic view from Sutro Tower over Downtown and back to Bernal Hill. And she’s charming as F**K for people that live simply, love nature, and just want a quintessential San Francisco home in a fantastic neighborhood! Freestanding and located at the rear a three unit property, you are surrounded by the neighbors gardens. Sometimes all you’ll hear are a few birds chatting and that’s it. It’s generally quiet around here. The current tenants will take many of their plants with them when they move. That said, you’ll still have mature trees including a lemon tree and there will be ground plants still here, just not all of them. 

Great Dining on Church St -- XO Coffee Shop is down on the corner! (I LOVE their Mocha Milano.)  LaCiccia, Pamelo, La Nebbia, and many others all nearby.  Cottage is located directly on Noe Valley/Glen Park Border. Easy access to Bernal Heights, Mission, 24th St in Noe Valley. A bit further and you find Dolores Park. Roam over the hill & land in Glen Park central. Noe Recreation Center is a 1/2 block over. Billy Goat Hill Park also nearby.

Due to the peculiar nature of our “Shelter in Place” situation, I am also going to attempt to answer a few questions that tend to come up for rentals and this cottage. 

 Why are the current tenants leaving? They are relocating to the East Bay for a variety of reasons, none of which have anything to do with this home.

 How long do people usually live in the cottage? I’d say tenants here average around 3 years, give or take. All have left for major life changes except one. That one left to move closer to downtown and desired a significantly more urban environment.  

Who else lives on the property? The front building has two units in it, each occupied by professional couples. Myself and these outgoing tenants find them to be lovely people.

Who manages the property? The owner self manages. I help find tenants and guide everyone through the application and lease process. The owner lives part time in San Francisco and not on the property itself.

How many people can live in the cottage? What about children? This is probably the trickiest question we get. We are absolutely open to children here!!! Thus far though we haven’t had any move in, only move out when their mom & dad went from a two top to a three top and decided they needed more space. In general it’s normally a single person or a couple that moves in. Whether or not you want to move in with a child/children will depend on your lifestyle and need for interior space. There just isn’t that much.

So how big is this cottage? We have not measured it. The bedroom has a queen bed in it in these photos. The sofa in the living room is a comfortable sized sofa, though not huge. The space available is what you see. There are no hidden areas. Find the 3d tour on the “Z” website for a tour.

Where is the laundry? Behind the door between the refrigerator and the bathroom.

When were the photos taken? On March 21, 2020, possibly the most gorgeous day EVER in San Francisco. Though Noe Valley often has nicer weather than much of SF, it does have requisite fog days and whatnot. Pristine air quality and gorgeous weather is not guaranteed everyday. Photos were taken with a cell phone and lightly edited for clarity.

Join us and come check out this spacious 2 bedroom apartment. Located on the 7th floor, this lovely home is not one you want to miss.

SoMa is one of the most up and coming neighborhoods in SF and stretches from the Mid Market area by Van Ness all the way East to the Embarcadero. It's an eclectic blend of sights, sounds, smells, and has something for every taste. It also changes rapidly; sometimes a block away can be an entirely different world!

Here at SoMa Square, we are located close to Rincon Hill and the Financial District and border 3rd street one of the main arteries of San Francisco. You'll find it convenient to be in the center of it all in a well kept area of SF. The Yerba Buena Gardens, Union Square shopping, wild and eclectic nightlife, soothing bay views of the Embarcadero, and the hustle and bustle of the FiDi are all a short distance away from your front door. 

If you need to get around the Bay, simply hop on BART or unlock a ZipCar and find yourself a mere block away from all major freeway entrances and on ramps. This is truly commuter's and walker's paradise.

You will find that our community is unlike any other in the area with our elevated central courtyard that feels like an oasis in the concrete jungle. You need to stop by on your apartment search and see that value, convenience, and comfort coalesce here at SoMa Square Apartments in San Francisco!

Come join us in our mansion in Nopa! Bear with me, I know it's roommates, but please check it out, we believe it is a way better deal than a studio you could get for this price. We currently have our master bedroom open that is by far the largest room, the walk-in closet is the largest in the city and comes with a private bathroom with a dedicated shower and bathtub. You have to see it for yourself! We think this is a great space for couples who want more than a simple studio.

While the apartment has 6 bedrooms (3BA) total, you can honestly never feel that way because it is so big. You have roommates when you want them, but a gigantic living room with 4 sun windows, a dining room with an extra comfy couch and nice views, as well as a den upstairs give everyone plenty of room to themselves when they need to. The kitchen has a 6-burner viking range, plenty of storage for all kitchen gadgets/pantry items, a dishwasher, as well as washer and dryer. You really have to see it in person to get a feel for it.

We are in the heart of Nopa, 2 blocks away from Divis. If you know it, it's super clean, quiet and neighborhoody, while in Divis has all the action you would want. We are right by the 5/5R/31 that brings you downtown in 15 minutes. We have a GoBike station on the same block and with the Wiggle, you can bike/scooter into the mission in 10 minutes. We have a Lucky's grocery store 5 minutes away, and Trader Joe's/Target/Bi-Rite 10 minute walk away. Golden Gate Park is 10 minutes away as well, or reading a book on Alamo Square while overlooking the city is just 5 minutes.

As for the people itself, we are looking to create a community of people that want to live together. The apartment is so big that you can always have space to yourself (which everyone needs to!), but we don't want to live in an apartment where everyone hides in their rooms. The apartment is too gorgeous for that. Currently we have

J (M)- He's originally from New Hampshire, MIT grad, knows everything about distributed systems and now a software engineer at Facebook.
J (F)- French-American, grew up in Paris loves everything cheese, bread and wine. A video editor learning about production on the side who’s big into sustainability, zero waste, farmers markets and the outdoors. 
K (F)- Another New Englander who got tired of shoveling her driveway. Works in restaurant operations and studies design on the side.
M (M)- Proud Canadian from Toronto. Really into wine, cycling and photography these days, but always found in the outdoors and appropriately works at Hipcamp.com
N (M)- Originally grew up in Berlin, Germany, watches football, but plays soccer. Dances sometimes https://nambrot.com/aroundtheworld

You - Interested in making this a clean, fun, yet relaxed home. The usual fine print of having a stable income, be a clean and courteous roommate apply. We have cleaners come by every 2 weeks and keep the place above-average clean in the first place. No pets unfortunately. The lease will be month-to-month, but we are looking for people that don't want their apartment to be just an collection of roommate after roommate like so many apartments in SF. Move-in is ASAP!

The apartment has all new appliances and washer/dryer inside the unit. 

 This building is designated as a landmark of historical significance.  Which also means it is located on bedrock and not landfill.  Re-habbed and retrofitted in 1996, this unit is a classic ""Brick and Timber"" loft with great style and architectural appeal.

The building is situated very well to restaurants, transit, and the downtown commercial district.  A short one block stroll and you will be on the Embarcadero where you will find a well-regarded Seafood restaurant and equally regarded steakhouse.  Across the street is a more casual dinning experience but the closest place to grab a meal.  If you walk another block down the Embarcadero towards the ferry building, you will find a fantastic neighborhood restaurant and bar.  And of course, there is always the Ferry Building itself, with multiple eateries and shops.  You are also a short stroll along the bay to AT&T Park, home of the San Francisco Giants baseball team.

One block away on the Embarcadero is the Muni Tram system, which can take you to many places across the city.  A few blocks walk down Spear street toward Market street will take you to the Embarcadero BART station which can take you across the city and under the bay to east bay locations.

Our neighborhood has fewer chain businesses and establishments, favoring local commerce and hidden gems that are free of too much tourist traffic. When you're looking for a handcrafted cocktail, some locally roasted coffee or a hip boutique full of vintage frocks and finds, look no further than SoMa. Come see what our artsy neighborhood has to offer!

Escape the madness and rent our Registered Historical home in Kalispell Montana. Built in 1919 with a half million dollar remodel just completed in 2019 this beautiful 5,00 sq. ft. classic is a dream property.  I am a master craftsman that uses mediums of concrete, wood, and steel.  I personally fabricated every concrete countertop, concrete sink, concrete shower and light fixture in this remodel.  I've poured my heart and soul into the design and finish to give you the best lodging experience in the Flathead valley. 

Besides being registered on the Historic Society list as a Historic Property, this home is a true one of a kind.  Built by the President of the Empire Lumber Co. and only owned by Judges and Doctors since the prestige in evident as soon as you walk in the door.  Location is everything.  and this property sits on the top of the hill in East Kalispell and is only 3 blocks from main street shopping and dining.  The tree lines streets of the East side offer endless walks to appreciate the century old architecture surrounding this home.  Glacier Park, Flathead Lake, Whitefish Mountain Resort, Whitefish Lake and Town are only minutes away so the central location of this property makes it a vacationers perfect location to play during the day then take a 5 minute walk to either the Bias Brewery or Kalispell Brewery to enjoy great local food and drinks.  
The finish and fixtures of the recent remodel are all top shelf, our bathrooms are Spa quality and the design is completely updated and custom.  Enjoy the new master bedroom which boasts massive 100 year old collar tie rafter bracing with the turnbuckles we salvaged from the Whitefish Fire Station built also in 1919.  
The Custom gourmet kitchen is now incorporated into the open floor plan of the dining and living room.  We took all measures to keep the original in this home.  the original double hung windows compliment the glaze filled interior doors and beautiful Bi-fold doors separating the dining/ living room space.  The 1.5"" maple strip floor was refinished to look brand new.

The photos attached have not been touched up at all, so what you see is what you get.

There are lots of scams here on Craigslist as we all know and this is not one of those.  After one email and one phone/video chat with me, you will see that easily and clearly.

Come check out one of our fabulous 1 bedroom apartments. This is the only type of 1 bedroom apartments that includes a washer and a dryer per unit. The living room is spacious and so is the actual bedroom itself. You also get two closets; one in the bedroom and one next to the washer/dryer.  

SoMa is one of the most up and coming neighborhoods in SF and stretches from the Mid Market area by Van Ness all the way East to the Embarcadero. It's an eclectic blend of sights, sounds, smells, and has something for every taste. It also changes rapidly; sometimes a block away can be an entirely different world!

Here at SoMa Square, we are located close to Rincon Hill and the Financial District and border 3rd street one of the main arteries of San Francisco. You'll find it convenient to be in the center of it all in a well kept area of SF. The Yerba Buena Gardens, Union Square shopping, wild and eclectic nightlife, soothing bay views of the Embarcadero, and the hustle and bustle of the FiDi are all a short distance away from your front door. 

If you need to get around the Bay, simply hop on BART or unlock a ZipCar and find yourself a mere block away from all major freeway entrances and on ramps. This is truly commuter's and walker's paradise.

You will find that our community is unlike any other in the area with our elevated central courtyard that feels like an oasis in the concrete jungle. You need to stop by on your apartment search and see that value, convenience, and comfort coalesce here at SoMa Square Apartments in San Francisco!

It is one floor above the street at the end of a remote cul de sac as the very top of the east side of the hill.  Fantastic views of the Bay, Bay Bridge and downtown and of the surrounding wooded cliff face. Tremendous privacy with surrounding open space such that no window coverings are needed except for the bedroom.  Home to the wild parrots and doves of Tel Hill. One bedroom plus Bay-facing deck plus modern kitchen, wood-burning fireplace, washer & dryer, hardwood floors, tub/shower. 
Hot water and heating included and free laundry in unit included.
A fair amount of storage in unit (4 closets+) and a vestibule at top of stairs which can serve as office or sitting area and for extra storage. No parking is in the building due to the steep cliff but there is on street cul de sac parking just outside essentially used by building residents only; there are only two buildings on the street and the other has a garage. There are buildings nearby offering parking for rent also.
Pets are ok at $50/mo.
Please email to see but only after being sure you have a keen interest because the Covid-19 situation necessitates minimizing intrusion on the existing tenant and excessive contacts.

Directly off the den is a wonderful sun-drenched deck to soak in the out of this world views. Down the hall is a powder room, a large master bedroom with a dressing room/closet & a large bathroom and stand alone tub. Another bedroom with an en suite bath completes this level. The lower level boasts a massive family room with a wet bar and fireplace. Car enthusiasts

8 Octavia is a new condo building in the vibrant Hayes Valley neighborhood at the corner of Market Street and Octavia Boulevard. This high-rise building houses 47units over ground floor retail. 

Amenities include a rooftop deck and common courtyards. Entry into the home is by smartphone. Flex space floor plans offer multiple rooms with sliding wall panels to maximize space. Units have energy efficient lighting and appliances, as well as user controlled window louvers to regulate solar heat. Interiors have wood flooring, European cabinetry, and floor to ceiling windows.

*

Features • 7.5”-wide Austrian grey oak plank floors • Automated individual louver system to modulate sunlight, views and privacy • Floor-to-ceiling glass windows • Exposed architectural concrete ceilings • VisiOnline keyless entry • Forced-air heating system • Sematic kitchen cabinets, Glacier White Corian countertops with integrated sink, fully integrated Liebherr refrigerator, Stainless Steel Bosch appliances and fully integrated dishwasher • Master and secondary bathrooms featuring Duravit features and Hansgrohe faucet • Secondary bathroom featuring a Saitowitz-designed Japanese soaking tub 

*

Louvers 8 Octavia’s louvered façade reinterprets a feature of early modern architecture for contemporary San Francisco. The slim, vertical louvers reach the full height of each floor and work to modulate natural light, views, and interior comfort while improving energy efficiency. Residents can adjust their experience throughout the day from floor-to-ceiling views to soft afternoon sun to evening privacy. 


 Landscape Stanley Saitowitz | Natoma Architects and Marta Fry Landscape Associates have blended architecture and landscape to compose a spacious urban retreat. A jewel-box viewing garden—a sculptural basalt stone, set in glass—imbues the entry lobby with a tranquil presence. At the rooftop terrace, finely detailed materials, plantings and furnishings create an open air lounge with commanding city views. 


Kitchens Beautiful, flexible and functional, the SieMatic handle-free kitchens— finished in Titan pine wood laminate and glacier white Corian countertops—are an essential component of 8 Octavia’s next-generation residential concept. Smart design features, developed over 40 years, include patented systems that maximize storage. 


Wood Refined yet warm, the wide-plank oak flooring, finished with natural oil, complements the modern interior. The sustainable, FSC-certified wood comes from the Benedictine monastery of Admont, Austria, which has cultivated wood products since its founding in 1074. 


Keyless Entry The innovative Visionline keyless entry system provides advanced security and enhanced control. Residents can access their home with a key fob as well as grant and monitor visitor access from anywhere in the world. The streamlined components and reader sit concealed within the door, seamlessly integrating with 8 Octavia’s clean design. 


Virtual Doorman State-of-the-art remote doorman service, the first of its kind offered in San Francisco, further enhances 8 Octavia’s security and convenience. Virtual Doorman’s professional operators are available 24/7 to greet guests, receive deliveries and assist residents. Using the integrated web portal and smartphone app, residents can grant access for visitors and services on the go. 

Temperature Control With Nest Thermostats residents enjoy optimal comfort while saving energy. Responsive technology learns individual preferences and patterns to provide just the right amount of warmth when it’s needed. The clear dial interface and mobile app enable easy control from any location. 

Connectivity A Webpass building-wide network supports 8 Octavia’s technology enhanced lifestyle. Residences come connected with premium, synchronous 200 Mbps internet service. A roof-terrace hot spot brings service outdoors.

Common spaces include a living room right next to the available bedroom and a very large kitchen with a stainless steel fridge, brand new gas oven/stove, and new dishwasher. The kitchen has plenty of counter space for cooking and several spacious cabinets. The bathroom is shared by all tenants and features dual sinks and tub with brand new showerhead. There is a washer/dryer and garbage/recycling/compost on site.

Rent for the room is $1,092.69 per month; security deposit is $1,131.67. Utilities average about $45-85 each month. Internet speed is over 100 megabits, and is $20/month per person. 

About your future roommates: We are two young professionals (one M, one F) in our mid-20s. One works for a tech company, and the other works for a luxury retail brand. Our house is pretty chill. We all have our own lives, but are always down to hang out at home on any given night.
The house is a quiet and relaxing retreat for us once we get off work or have had a busy weekend out with friends. We are people that keep things clean and would like someone who will take initiative to help out around the house (such as taking out the trash, emptying the dishwasher, cleaning the common spaces). Our landlord lives a few houses down from us and is always available to help with maintenance issues or any other problems we may have.

About the neighborhood: the house is located in Silver Terrace (near Portola), close to bus routes 8, 9, 24, & 44. The 44 will take you to the Glen Park BART station. There are a few grocery stores, restaurants, and gas stations within walking distance of the house. Street parking is available throughout the neighborhood, and the house is easily accessible to the 101 & 280 freeways.

If you have any questions about the room, the house, or the roommates please feel free to reach out. Since the Bay Area is going through a very difficult time right now, if you are interested in the room, we can schedule a virtual (Skype/Zoom/Facetime) apartment showing. We would love to get to know you and share more about ourselves.

It will come available as of April 15th.
Just a Short walk to Bart, Muni & Caltrain lines.
½ a block to Whole Foods, and 2 blocks to Target.

We usually go with a 12-month agreement, but especially catering to Doctors and other Medical Professionals we will consider even a 3, 4, or 6 month shorter-term stay.

Right on Folsom near 4th Street.
Easy walking to everywhere downtown.

*High-Speed Internet WiFi is set and Included.
*All cookware, dishware, and even starter condiments are there upon arrival.
*Microwave, Coffee Maker, Hot Water Pot, Iron, Ironing board and more are here.
*Stainless Steel with a Granite Top Kitchen awaits with an in-unit washer & dryer!
*Beautiful wood flooring and a Carpeted Queen Size Bedroom with a Walk-In Closet.
*Larger than normal, nicely tiled full bathroom with shower over tub.
*Light and bright with walls of windows to let in lots of natural light and fresh air.
*The building and the unit are only approximately 12 years old.
*You will find it Suitcase Ready with style and comfort, as an inclusive rate of $ 3700
*There is an Amazing Tropical Outdoor Center Courtyard to enjoy steps from your door.

For consideration, If interested and qualified, please reply with one very detailed email.  Due to current health care considerations viewings will not take place until April 15th.  This is a great condo in the perfect SOMA location and for those reasons, in the past, it has been easy for me to lease it out sight unseen when necessary. The photos attached have not been touched up at all, so what you see is what you get.

There are lots of scams here on Craigslist as we all know and this is not one of those.  After one email and one phone/video chat with me, you will see that easily and clearly.  This unit when it comes available always moves quickly.  UNIQUE: Because of how this unit sits in the back corner of the building overlooking a narrow side street, it is an extremely quiet unit the likes of what is hard to find anywhere in San Francisco.
